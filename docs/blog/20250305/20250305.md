# Exploring sched_ext: BPF-Powered CPU Schedulers in the Linux Kernel
The Linux kernel's scheduler is one of its most critical components, determining which tasks run on which CPUs and for how long.

But in today's complex computing environments, the default Linux scheduler doesn't always provide optimal performance for specialized workloads. This is where sched_ext (SCX) comes in – a framework that allows implementing custom CPU schedulers in BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and loading them dynamically. In this technical analysis.

I'll examine the architecture and implementation of SCX schedulers, with a particular focus on scx_rustland and scx_bpflandand, compared to traditional schedulers.

## What is sched_ext?
### Sched_ext

Linux kernel 6.12 introduced `sched_ext` (“extensible scheduler”) as a new scheduling class that allows pluggable CPU schedulers via eBPF

Enables implementing and dynamically loading thread schedulers written in BPF means it unlike traditional scheduler modifications that require kernel recompilation and rebooting, `sched_ext` defines a set of hook points (operations) that an eBPF-based scheduler can implement (such as picking the next task, enqueuing/dequeuing tasks, etc.)

* **BPF struct_ops**: Used to define a scheduling policy through callback functions
* **Dispatch queues** (DSQs): Used for task queuing and execution
* **Safety mechanisms**: Prevent system crashes from buggy schedulers


 scx project is a collection of `sched_ext` schedulers and tools. Schedulers in scx range from simple demonstrative policies to production-oriented ones tailored for specific use cases:
*  **scx_simple** : uses a basic FIFO or least-run-time policy
*  **scx_nest** : places tasks on high-frequency cores
*  **scx_lavd** : is optimized for gaming workloads
*  **scx_rusty** : partitions CPUs by last-level cache to improve locality
*  **scx_bpfland** : threads that block frequently (i.e. perform many voluntary context switches per second) are assumed to be interactive, and thus prioritized

Each scheduler in SCX implements the required sched_ext hooks (via eBPF programs) and can be selected at runtime. The default Linux scheduler can always be restored if needed
### End-to-End Task Lifecycle in sched_ext

I'll provide a deep dive into the end-to-end task flow in sched_ext, specifically examining how tasks move through the scheduling cycle. This will cover:

* The reception of a task
* How it is enqueued and dequeued
* The scheduling decisions made
#### Task Entry into sched_ext
1. Once a BPF scheduler is loaded, all tasks with policy `SCHED_EXT` are switched to the new `sched_ext` scheduling class
2. a task is under `sched_ext` management (either by being created with `SCHED_EXT` or through a global switch), it will be integrated into the BPF scheduler's queues.
3. The kernel’s `sched_ext` core calls the BPF scheduler’s `ops.init_task()` callback for each task joining `sched_ext`, giving the BPF code to initialize per-task state (e.g. tracking virtual runtime, etc.)
4. At this point, the task is “received” by `sched_ext` – it’s now subject to the BPF scheduling logic rather than the default CFS rules.
#### Enqueuing and Dequeuing Mechanisms in sched_ext
1. **Dispatch Queues (DSQs)**: sched_ext uses dispatch queues (DSQs) as intermediate run queues between the BPF logic and actual CPU execution
By default, there is one global FIFO queue (designated `SCX_DSQ_GLOBAL`) and one local DSQ per CPU (`SCX_DSQ_LOCAL`).
**Tasks are dispatched into DSQs by the BPF code, and CPUs consume from DSQs to get their next runnable task**
2. **Enqueueing a task**: When a task becomes runnable, the `sched_ext` core invokes the BPF scheduler’s `ops.select_cpu()` followed by `ops.enqueue()` callbacks.
    - it may call `scx_bpf_dispatch(p, SCX_DSQ_LOCAL, SCX_SLICE_DFL, enq_flags)` to place the task directly into the target CPU’s local queue
    - Or it might dispatch to the global queue (`SCX_DSQ_GLOBAL`) or a custom DSQ.
#### Scheduling Logic and Decision-Making Process

 We know the actual decision of which task runs next on each CPU is made by the interplay of the `ops.dispatch()` and (optionally) `ops.consume()` callbacks, in conjunction with the dispatch queues. The scheduling cycle on a CPU, from a high-level perspective, is as follows:
 - **Selecting a target CPU on wakeup** – `select_cpu()`, This function allows the scheduler to choose an optimal CPU for the task before it is enqueued. For example, a scheduler might want to put a waking task on the same CPU it ran last (for cache affinity) or find an idle CPU to improve latency.
 - **Enqueue decision** – `enqueue()`: As described above, the BPF scheduler’s `.enqueue()` either dispatches the task to a DSQ (local, global, or custom) or holds it in an internal queue
 - **CPU picks next task** – consumption and dispatch: the scheduler core asks `sched_ext` for the next task to run. The CPU first check local DSQ for any tasks waiting. Then, that task is dequeued and chosen to run immediately. If the local DSQ is empty, the CPU can try to consume from a global shared queue.
 - **Dispatching tasks from BPF scheduler** – `dispatch()`: If after consuming global the CPU still has no task, the core invokes the BPF scheduler’s `ops.dispatch() `callback
 
 
 
 
 
## Build and run sched_ext
I use [blog](https://arighi.blogspot.com/2024/04/getting-started-with-sched-ext.html) post by Andrea Righi outlines a great workflow for testing sched_ext without modifying  existing system
### Run the virtual environment and test a scheduler
First, start the virtual environment with the sched_ext kernel:
```bash
vng -vr ../linux
```
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJrK0yQj1e.png)

Once inside the virtual environment, you can run one of the schedulers with the helper function:


```
scx ./build/scheds/c/scx_simple
```

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyryLyXj1g.png)

## C-Based Schedulers

**scx_simple** 

`scx_simple` is a minimal scheduler that functions either as a global weighted vtime scheduler (similar to the Completely Fair Scheduler) or as a FIFO scheduler. It's designed primarily to demonstrate basic scheduling concepts 

In the code below, from `scx_simple.bpf.c`, the `.enqueue` callback handles a task that needs to be scheduled. 
1. If the scheduler is in FIFO mode (fifo_sched == true), it simply inserts the task into the shared dispatch queue without any priority sorting. 

2. If in normal (weighted vtime) mode, it retrieves the task’s current virtual time (p->scx.dsq_vtime), adjusts it so that no task gains more than one slice worth of idle credit, 

3. inserts the task into the shared queue with that virtual time as the key:

```C
void BPF_STRUCT_OPS(simple_enqueue, struct task_struct *p, u64 enq_flags) {
    stat_inc(1);  // increment global queue count
    if (fifo_sched) {
        // FIFO scheduling: enqueue to shared queue with default slice
        scx_bpf_dsq_insert(p, SHARED_DSQ, SCX_SLICE_DFL, enq_flags);
    } else {
        u64 vtime = p->scx.dsq_vtime;
        // Cap the vtime lag to one slice to prevent too much credit
        if (time_before(vtime, vtime_now - SCX_SLICE_DFL))
            vtime = vtime_now - SCX_SLICE_DFL;
        // Enqueue with a specific virtual time for fairness
        scx_bpf_dsq_insert_vtime(p, SHARED_DSQ, SCX_SLICE_DFL, vtime, enq_flags);
    }
}

```
## scx_rustland
`scx_rustland` is designed to prioritize interactive workloads over CPU-intensive background workloads.

In practical terms, this likely means it keeps track of each task’s recent CPU usage or blocking behavior and assigns higher priority (sooner scheduling, more CPU time) to tasks that have shorter CPU bursts.
### scx_rustland overiew
`scx_rustland` uses a hybrid approach that splits functionality between kernel space and user space:

```
User Space: Complex scheduling logic in Rust
    - Task prioritization
    - CPU selection algorithms
    - Complex data structures
    |
    | Ring buffer communication
    v
Kernel Space: Minimal BPF component
    - Task state tracking
    - Dispatch queue management
    - Safety mechanisms
```

**BPF Dispatcher (scx_rustland_core)**: The BPF part of scx_rustland implements minimal logic required to interface with the kernel. Its enqueue hook, for example, does not directly decide a run queue as a normal scheduler would. Instead, it may place the task into a BPF queue map that represents “tasks waiting for user-space decision.” 

**User-Space Scheduler** (**Rust**): On the user side, the Rust scheduler process uses libraries (like libbpf or Aya in Rust) to interact with the eBPF program. It attaches to the maps exposed by BPF. Typically, it might use a ring buffer to receives a task to schedule, it runs its algorithm to decide where/when that task should run. 

### scx_rustland Code Structure
```
scheds/rust/scx_rustland/
├── Cargo.toml                 # Rust package definition

```

`scx_rustland` has two main components:



BPF Component (kernel space):



```c
void BPF_STRUCT_OPS(rustland_enqueue, struct task_struct *p, u64 enq_flags)
{
    // Skip scheduling the scheduler itself
    if (is_usersched_task(p))
        return;

    // Pass task information to userspace for scheduling decision
    struct queued_task_ctx *task = bpf_ringbuf_reserve(&queued, sizeof(*task), 0);
    if (!task) {
        // Fallback: direct dispatch if userspace communication fails
        scx_bpf_dsq_insert_vtime(p, SHARED_DSQ, SCX_SLICE_DFL, 0, enq_flags);
        return;
    }
    
    // Send task info to userspace
    populate_task_info(task, p, enq_flags);
    bpf_ringbuf_submit(task, 0);
}
```






### Scheduling Logic

The scheduling logic in `scx_rustland` is split across kernel (BPF) and user-space





```rust
// Main scheduler object
struct Scheduler<'a> {
    bpf: BpfScheduler<'a>,                  // BPF connector
    stats_server: StatsServer<(), Metrics>, // statistics
    task_pool: TaskTree,                    // tasks ordered by deadline
    task_map: TaskInfoMap,                  // map pids to the corresponding task information
    min_vruntime: u64,                      // Keep track of the minimum vruntime across all tasks
    init_page_faults: u64,                  // Initial page faults counter
    slice_ns: u64,                          // Default time slice (in ns)
    slice_ns_min: u64,                      // Minimum time slice (in ns)
}
```


### TBD
* rustland_select_cpu: Selects a CPU for a task
* rustland_enqueue: Handles a task becoming ready to run
* rustland_dispatch: Dispatches tasks that are ready to run
* rustland_running: Called when a task starts on its CPU
* rustland_stopping: Called when a task stops running
## scx_bpfland

`scx_bpfland` implements its scheduling logic almost entirely in BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) code that runs in kernel space. It follows a more traditional approach where all scheduling decisions happen within the kernel:

```
`scx_bpfland` implements all scheduling callbacks directly in BPF:
```c
void BPF_STRUCT_OPS(bpfland_enqueue, struct task_struct *p, u64 enq_flags)
{
    // Implementation directly in BPF
    struct task_ctx *task_ctx;
    u64 vruntime = 0;
    
    // Skip enqueuing the scheduler itself
    if (p->pid == bpfland_pid)
        return;
    
    // Get or create task context
    task_ctx = get_task_ctx(p);
    if (!task_ctx)
        return;
    
    // Calculate vruntime based on scheduling policy
    vruntime = calc_vruntime(p, task_ctx, enq_flags);
    
    // Direct enqueue to DSQ with calculated vruntime
    scx_bpf_dsq_insert_vtime(p, GLOBAL_DSQ, task_slice(p), vruntime, enq_flags);
}
```
