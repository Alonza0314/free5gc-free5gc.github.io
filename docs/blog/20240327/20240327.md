Continuing our exploration of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Part 1 and Part 2 have provided a comprehensive understanding of the architecture, key components, and registration processes within the IMS framework. In Part 3, we delve into the intricate procedures of IMS call handling and look toward the future developments and innovations expected within this dynamic telecommunications landscape.

## Media Flow / Call Procedure
After successful registration, the following steps will be processed when a user initiates a communication session (e.g., make a call).

### SIP INVITE and 100 Trying
A SIP INVITE message aims to initiate a session between two endpoints. When a user wants to make a call, their SIP client sends an INVITE request to the SIP server, specifying the desired recipient and various parameters such as the media types (audio, video, etc.) and codecs for encoding the media.

The 100 Trying response in the context of the SIP is an informational response indicating that the request has been received and the server is working on a response. It serves as an interim response while the server processes the INVITE request or performs other tasks related to call setup.


- **Caller to Orig P-CSCF**
    - The caller sends the SIP INVITE request, including an initial SDP, to the P-CSCF, which is determined via the CSCF discovery mechanism. 
    - The initial SDP may encompass one or more media streams for a multi-media session.

- **Orig P-CSCF to Orig S-CSCF**
    - The originating P-CSCF knows the next hop CSCF since the UE has been registered.
    - The originating P-CSCF determines whether the INVITE message needs priority treatment based on the user profile saved during registration, the priority specified by the user, and/or the MPS code/identifier contained in the INVITE message.
    - If the session needs priority handling, the originating P-CSCF inserts or replaces the priority indication and forwards the INVITE to the originating S-CSCF. 

- **Orig S-CSCF to Term I-CSCF**
    - The originating S-CSCF validates the service profile and, if a Globally Routable User Agent URI (GRUU) is received as the contact, ensures that the Public User Identity associated with the served user in the request matches the Public User Identity linked to the GRUU, both belonging to the same service profile. 
    - Then the originating S-CSCF triggers any origination service logic necessary for this user
        - e.g., Authorization of the requested SDP based on the user's subscription for multi-media services. 

    - The originating S-CSCF analyzes the destination address, identifies the network operator the subscriber is affiliated with and forwards the SIP INVITE request. 
    - When the INVITE message contains a priority indication, the originating S-CSCF forwards the INVITE along with the Service User's priority level if available.
    - If the destination is local, the request is directed to a local I-CSCF for further processing.

- **Term I-CSCF to Term S-CSCF**
    - The terminated I-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to the terminated S-CSCF.
    - The S-CSCF validates the service profile and triggers any termination service logic required for this user. 
        - e.g., Authorization of the requested SDP based on the user's subscription for multi-media services.

- **Term S-CSCF to Term P-CSCF**
    - The terminated S-CSCF knows the next hop CSCF for this UE and forwards the INVITE to the terminated P-CSCF in the visited network.

- **Term P-CSCF to Callee**
    - If the terminated P-CSCF identifies that the termination is for a Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) session, it extracts the session information. It initiates dynamic policy enforcement by transmitting the derived session details to the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) or Policy Control Function (PCF). 
    - The terminated P-CSCF recalls (from the registration procedure) the UE address and forwards the INVITE to the UE.

### 180 ringing 
- If the UE needs user input before finalizing the session setup, it may alert the user and await their response. In such cases, it notifies the originating party with a provisional response, specifically indicating "Ringing." 
- This message is transmitted to the P-CSCF and forwarded along the signaling path to the originating endpoint.

### 200 OK    
- The 200 OK response indicates that the callee has accepted the call invitation and has successfully established the session. It contains essential information such as session parameters, codecs, and media descriptions for both parties to begin communication.
- This message is transmitted to the P-CSCF and forwarded along the signaling path to the originating endpoint.

### ACK
- After receiving the 200 OK response from the callee, the caller sends an ACK message to confirm the successful reception of the acceptance. The ACK message acknowledges the receipt of the 200 OK response and finalizes the call setup process. 
- It ensures that both ends of the call are synchronized and ready to proceed with the communication session.
- This message is transmitted to the P-CSCF and forwarded along the signaling path to the terminated endpoint.

### RTP Streams
- RTP streams are designed to deliver media in real-time with minimal delay, which is essential for IMS voice and video communication. They use UDP to transport media data, providing a continuous stream of packets representing the media content. The RTP protocol also supports mechanisms for synchronizing audio and video streams, handling packet loss, and ensuring media quality during the call.
- Once the SIP handshake is complete, RTP streams are established between the caller and the callee. 
- These streams carry the actual media (voice, video, etc.) over the network.
