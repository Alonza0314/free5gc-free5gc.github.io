## 5G LAN-type Services

5G LAN-type service provides services with similar functionalities to Local Area Networks (LANs) and VPN’s but improved with 5G capabilities such as high performance, **long distance access, mobility and security**.

For instance, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) moving inside a large factory may communicate and cooperate through 5G LAN technology with low latency. This could be hard to achieve through Wi-fi due to the possibility of handover issue.

## 5G VN Group

### 5G VN group management

A 5G VN group is characterized by the following:

- **5G VN group identities**: 
    used to identify the 5G VN group.
    - External Group ID
    - Internal Group ID
- **5G VN group membership**: 
    used to uniquely identify 5G VN group members.
    - GPSIs
- **5G VN group data**
    - PDU session type
    - DNN
    - S-NSSAI
    - Application descriptor
    - Information related with secondary authentication / authorization (e.g. to enable IP address assignment by the DN-AAA).

The 5G VN groups and 5G VN members are managed (e.g. add/delete/modify) via a set of services exposed by NEF.

### 5G VN group creation

![VN group management procedure 1](./VN%20group%20management%20procedure%201.png)


- A 5G VN group is identified by the AF using **External Group ID**.
- The NEF provides the External Group ID to UDM.
- The **UDM** maps the External Group ID to **Internal Group ID.** 
For a newly created 5G VN Group, an Internal Group ID is determined by the UDM.

After the 5G VN group is created, UE with corresponding DNN and S-NSSAI would get the UE policy associated with the 5G VN group in the registration procedure.

- After Registration Accept in the General Registration Procedure, the AMF performs a **UE Policy Association Establishment** procedure.
- In the UE Policy Association Establishment procedure, the AMF sends a Npcf_UEPolicyControl Create Request, which contains the Internal-Group-ID-list of the UE and UE Policy Container, to PCF.
- The PCF then get the **5G VN group data** and **5G VN group membership** for each Internal-Group-ID received from the AMF using Nudr_DM_Query (Internal-Group-Id, Subscription Data, 5G VN Group Configuration).

- The PCF triggers **UE Configuration Update Procedure** to **update UE policy** and sends the UE policy container including UE policy information to the UE.
- PCF invokes **Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer** service operation provided by the AMF. The message includes SUPI, **UE Policy Container**.
- the AMF transfers transparently the UE Policy container (UE policy information) received from the PCF to the UE using **DL NAS TRANSPORT message**.

### 5G VN Group Communication

There are three types of traffic forwarding methods allowed for 5G VN communication:

- **Local switch**, where traffic is locally forwarded by a single UPF if this UPF is the common PSA UPF of different PDU Sessions for the same 5G VN group.

- **N19-based**, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN group communication is forwarded between PSA UPFs of different PDU sessions via N19. N19 is based on a shared User Plane tunnel connecting PSA UPFs of a single 5G VN group.

- **N6-based**, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN communication is forwarded to/from the DN;

Traffic forwarding within the 5G VN group is realized by using a UPF internal interface ("5G VN internal")
