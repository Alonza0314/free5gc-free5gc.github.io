## Roles of PCC Rules and Session Rules

In 5G networks, managing service quality for diverse applications is critical to providing users with a consistent experience. PCC, which stands for Policy and Charging Control, rules play a central role in regulating traffic flows, enforcing quality standards, and adapting network resources according to real-time conditions.

Session Rules serve as the operational framework for implementing PCC decisions at the user session level. They are responsible for managing session establishment, maintenance, and termination while ensuring proper resource allocation and QoS enforcement. These rules translate high-level policy decisions into concrete network behaviors, coordinating between different network functions to maintain service quality and optimize resource utilization throughout the session lifecycle.

## Abstract of Network Functions

- **PCF(Policy Control Function)**: The PCF is responsible for generating PCC rules based on the service requirements and network conditions.
- **SMF(Session Management Function)**: The SMF is responsible for translating PCC rules received from the PCF into actionable configurations on the user plane.
- **UPF(User Plane Function)**: The UPF enforces the PDRs based on the rules set by SMF.
- **UE(User Equipment)**: The UE is the terminal equipment that connects to the network and communicates with the core network.

## Process of Mapping PCC Rules into Session Rules

1. PCF transmits PCC rules to SMF.
2. SMF processes PCC rules.
3. Data path establishment.
4. QoS configuration.
5. Flow control setup.
6. Charging rule generation.
7. Session rule generation.
8. PFCP session establishment.
9. Data path activation.
10. Dynamic update of session rules.

## Conclusion

The mapping of PCC rules into session rules is a critical process in 5G networks, ensuring that high-level policy decisions are effectively translated into concrete network behaviors. This process involves collaboration between the PCF, SMF, UPF, and UE, coordinating between different network functions to maintain service quality and optimize resource utilization throughout the session lifecycle.
